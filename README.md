# assembleAPotluckGuestList
Created with CodeSandbox
 
I used JavaScript to assemble my party guest list. But this isn't just any potluck, this is an exclusive potluck where only 8 of my best friends are allowed to attend. C'est chic!

To build this program, I worked with event handlers, function expressions, and querySelectorAll().
